# Helium Leak Test Procedure (EN 13185 / ISO 20485)

**Scope:** Applies to all /FS joints and welded assemblies subject to Table 6 leakage acceptance.  
**Method:** Helium mass-spectrometer testing (vacuum or sniff) per EN 13185 and ISO 20485.

1. **Preparation** – Verify calibration status of the leak detector and reference leak. Record instrument serial, calibration due date, and sensitivity.
2. **Background check** – Confirm ambient helium background below 1.0×10⁻¹⁰ mbar·L/s before measurement. Document readings.
3. **Test setup** – Connect to component or system test port (use /FS nut test ports where fitted). Apply vacuum or tracer gas in accordance with component rating.
4. **Measurement** – Scan each joint; acceptance limits shall meet or exceed Table 6 values for the relevant component class. Note any corrective action taken.
5. **Post-test** – Return system to operating pressure, reinstall protective caps, and replace tamper ties if disturbed.
6. **Records** – Log tag ID, method (vacuum/sniff), measured leak rate, acceptance limit, operator, and instrument data. File results in the project QA archive and update RTM references.
