# Double-Block-and-Bleed (DBB) Purge Procedure for /FS Assemblies

**Scope:** Applies to serviceable metal gasket face-seal joints on QINFRA.U/W/S, WCS.HP/LP/VLP (and optional WCS.R) warm helium lines.  
**Objective:** Limit residual air to ≤0.05% and capture helium losses while protecting Table 6 leakage acceptance.

1. **Isolation** – Close upstream and downstream diaphragm valves to establish DBB. Confirm position with limit switches where fitted.
2. **Connect bleed** – Attach the face-seal bleed tee to either a recovery header (preferred) or a Venturi eductor assembly driven by dry nitrogen. Verify `/FS` gaskets and tamper tags prior to connection.
3. **Pull-down** – Open bleed valve and evacuate the cavity to ≤50 mbar(a) equivalent. If using an eductor, confirm motive ΔP is within vendor limits.
4. **Helium backfill** – Close bleed, backfill with clean helium to 1.05 bar(a), vent to WCS.LP (or recovery) and repeat Steps 3–4 three times.
5. **Analyze** – Measure residual impurity with the assigned analyzer. Proceed only if residual air ≤0.05% (or more stringent project limit).
6. **Break joint** – Release tamper wire, remove the /FS nut, discard used gasket, and install a new metal gasket (record alloy and batch/heat number).
7. **Re-make and test** – Assemble joint per torque/turn procedure, install new tamper wire and seal, perform helium mass-spectrometer test versus Table 6 acceptance, and log helium usage.
8. **Records** – Update purge log with tag, technician, residual %, helium loss, analyzer ID, gasket batch, and tamper seal ID
