# DBB + Eductor Purge Procedure (/FS Assemblies)

## Purpose
Maintain helium Grade 5.0 purity and limit losses when servicing metal gasket face-seal joints on QINFRA.U/W/S and WCS lines.

## Prerequisites
- Verify analyzer readings within limits prior to intervention.
- Confirm Venturi eductor (dry N₂ motive) or recovery header is available.
- Ensure new metal gaskets (SS/Ni/Cu as specified) and tamper seals are on hand.

## Steps
1. **Isolate** the module using upstream and downstream diaphragm valves (DBB). Confirm bleed valve closed.
2. **Connect** bleed tee to recovery header or Venturi eductor exhaust; supply dry N₂ motive gas per vendor data.
3. **Pull-down** cavity to ≤50 mbar(a). Close bleed, charge with helium to 1.05 bar(a), vent to WCS.LP or recovery. Repeat three cycles.
4. **Verify** purity using portable analyzer (H₂O/N₂) or installed analyzer sample point. Acceptance: residual air ≤0.05 % equivalent.
5. **Break** /FS joint, discard used gasket, install new gasket, re-make joint to OEM torque/turn.
6. **Leak test** assembly per ISO 20485 / EN 13185 with acceptance limits from Table 6.
7. **Record** purge cycles, analyzer readings, helium loss estimate, gasket batch, tamper-seal ID, operator signature in maintenance log.

## Notes
- Capture eductor motive pressure and duration for KPI tracking.
- If analyzer exceeds threshold, extend purge cycles or investigate ingress.
- Dispose of used gaskets per cleanroom waste procedure.
