        The Contractor shall be fully responsible for ensuring that the
        Deliverables and Services provided fully meet the specified
        requirements for the Contract. Therefore, the Applicant shall
        duly analyse the SCK CEN's Tender Documents and evaluate whether
        sufficient information is presented to allow the Applicant to
        put forward a proposal that ensures the delivery of the procured
        items meets the specified requirements. If certain information
        is found to be lacking, the Applicant shall request this
        information from SCK CEN without undue delay (according to §1.6
        of the Main Tender Document).

        In accordance with §1.7 of the Main Tender Document, the
        Contractor may no longer rely on information lacking after
        submission of its offer. If the Contractor identifies a lack of
        information during the performance of the Contract, this shall
        not give rise to any basis for a Variation.

        In the offer, the Applicant shall explicitly list all additional
        requirements (beyond those specified by SCK CEN) which have been
        defined by the Applicant, and which are assumed to be necessary
        for fulfilling the intended function, performance, or
        integration of the proposed solution. All such assumptions and
        requirements shall be clearly identified, justified, and
        documented as part of the offer. These additional requirements
        may be used as a basis for the system design and/or
        verification.

        The technical requirements imposed by SCK CEN (including, but
        not limited to norms and other standards, processes, and their
        parameters) applicable to the development, performance, and
        quality (inspections, tests, etc.) of the procured items are
        specified in the present document and all other documents
        referred to herein. In principle, these requirements are
        mandatory, unless adjusted in accordance with the principles set
        forth in the subsequent paragraphs.

        In the offer, the Applicant shall clearly state any deviation if
        certain technical requirements are not met (e.g. if a requested
        norm, standard, or preferred process parameter is not
        implemented), The Applicant shall provide a clear description
        and justification for the proposed alternative.

        In the offer, the Applicant may suggest modifications to the
        technical requirements imposed by this document, where such
        modifications improve cost, reliability, safety, ease of use, or
        any other functional aspect of the QPLANT. Each modification
        shall be supported by an assessment of its advantages and
        drawbacks.

        In the offer, the Applicant shall:

-   Submit a single offer, inclusive of all proposed modifications,
    representing the most optimal solution. Multiple alternative offers
    shall not be permitted.

-   Include an overview of the main Contract activities. For each
    activity, the Applicant shall detail how requirements will be met,
    the selected processes and techniques that shall be implemented.

-   Provide at least the details as requested in the present document.
    If no detail level is defined in this document, the Applicant is to
    choose, based on its experience, the appropriate (level of)
    detail(s) to be provided in relation to the criticality and/or
    complexity of the activity.

    During negotiations, deviations and modifications shall be discussed
    between SCK CEN and the Applicant. SCK CEN reserves the right to
    refuse any deviation or modification at its sole discretion and
    without justification. Only deviations and modifications with prior
    written approval from SCK CEN may be implemented.
