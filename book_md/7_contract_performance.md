    1.  []{#_Toc191379878 .anchor}General Organization

        In accordance with article 20.1 of Addendum I, the Contractor
        shall assign a member of its staff to be responsible for the
        follow-up of the Contract (further referred to as "Project
        Manager"). The Project Manager shall be responsible for
        planning, organizing, monitoring, and controlling, and directing
        the performance of the Contract, to ensure that the Contract is
        accomplished on time, within budget, and compliant to the
        requirements laid down in the Contract.

        The Contractor shall notify SCK CEN in writing in case a
        different Project Manager is appointed. Replacement of the
        Project Manager is subject to prior written approval by SCK CEN.
        In case of replacement, the substitute shall always have a level
        of education, skills, and experience equivalent to or better
        than the original resource proposed for this role.

        At the conclusion of the Contract, SCK CEN shall designate the
        Leading Officer for the Contract and inform the Contractor. The
        Contractor shall be notified of any change in writing.

        Regarding the practical follow-up of the Contract, SCK CEN
        reserves the right to have itself represented by a third party
        of its choice, acting on its behalf (further referred to as
        "Representative(s)").

        In this respect, SCK CEN grants to the Representative(s) the
        same rights as SCK CEN have accrued under the present Contract
        and the Contractor shall give effect thereto. The Contractor
        shall grant the Representatives the same access rights (physical
        access, document access, \...) as have been contractually
        instated for SCK CEN.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, SCK CEN will remain the sole
        principal to the Contract and therefore:

    <!-- -->

    i.  any approval/acceptance/equivalent step which has been
        contractually set, shall only be approved, respectively
        accepted, if and to the extent that SCK CEN has confirmed its
        approval, respectively acceptance, of such step in writing.

    <!-- -->

    i.  any decision to deviate from the terms and conditions as have
        been contractually agreed upon, may only be implemented after
        having obtained approval thereto from SCK CEN in writing.

    <!-- -->

        documents, offers, technical documentation, any correspondence,
        and all meetings, related to the Contract, shall be in English.

        Any information that a Party considers significant enough to

        -- directed by SCK CEN to the Contractor shall be adequately
        responded to within five Business Days. If such request cannot
        be answered within this lead time, e.g. due to a technical
        question requiring additional time to be answered, the
        Contractor shall at least communicate (within this lead time)
        when SCK CEN will receive the answer.

        If the Contractor anticipates any delays or difficulties in
