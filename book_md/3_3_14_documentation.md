    1.  []{#_Toc200492592 .anchor}Documentation

464. All project-related documents, including but not limited to the CAD
     model, shall be uploaded to the SCK Coreshare platform.

465. All documents shall follow standardized file naming conventions and
     metadata formats to ensure clear identification, version control,
     and lifecycle management.

The active project runs from T0 at start of L1 to L6.

466. Throughout Contract performance the Contractor shall, at a minimum,
     deliver the documentation listed in Table 18.

467. As part of #DD04, the Contractor shall provide the necessary
     technical data and design datasheets of critical components such as
     heat exchangers, piping, rotating machines, and valve information
     with sufficient detail to allow SCK CEN to model the complete
     cryogenic system including the cryogenic plant in simulations.

468. The Contractor shall deliver a maintenance manual and lifecycle
     strategy documentation, including but not limited to:

-   Spare inventory and obsolescence plans

-   PPE, alarms, and recovery training

-   Simulation-driven scenario testing

-   OPEX estimations.

-   Maintenance checks, functional testing

-   MTBF-based planning and condition diagnostics

-   Operator commissioning and technician maintenance and replacement
    involvement

-   Real-time MTBF vs prediction curve tracking

469. The process flow diagrams, process and instrumentation diagrams and
     temperature-entropy diagrams showing all the operation modes
     (including cool down) of the QPLANT shall be subject to approval by
     SCK CEN.

470. The Contractor shall, at the Preliminary Design Review (PDR), which
     is the end of the LCP1 (Concept Design), provide 3-D CAD cut-aways
     and maintenance envelopes demonstrating safe human access to all
     QRB components and instrumentation located inside the vacuum
     vessel.
