        1.  []{#_Toc202536241 .anchor}Level Agreement (Option 3)

            It provides one (1) year of post-commissioning operational
            support. SCK CEN may, by mutual agreement, extend the SLA
            for one (1) additional year. The SLA expressly excludes
            integrated commissioning activities that involve end-user
            participation (e.g. Control and Interlock System (CIS)
            interfacing or operational testing performed by SCK CEN
            personnel). Such activities fall outside the Contractor's
            contractual obligations. For scope details and exclusions,
            refer to Section 2.1.
