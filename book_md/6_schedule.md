Applicant shall develop the phases according to its own expertise and
experience and propose a detailed work schedule. In doing so, the
Applicant shall take into consideration the preliminary schedule in
[6.2]{.smallcaps} by including the milestones and respecting the
milestone dates provided in Table 23. The Applicant may add (to a
reasonable extent) additional milestones as they think appropriate.

     with technical specifications, defining the list of components
     (incl. procurement specifications, manufacturing drawings), setting
     final requirements for buildings and utilities, developing plans
     and procedures for the next phases (e.g. MIP, packaging and
     transportation plan, installation plan) and preparing/ submitting
     the Detailed Design File

**Phase II -- Procurement, Assembly and Manufacturing (L3)**

i.  Activities expected to be performed in this phase shall, at least,
    include:

ii. Procurement/ manufacturing of components and services necessary for
    performing the Contract, execution/ reporting of tests and
