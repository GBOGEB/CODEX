The Contractor shall provide all mobile vacuum pumping systems required
during installation, commissioning, and related project execution
activities. This system shall be utilised for the pumping and
conditioning of various components, including storage vessels. It is not
part of the permanent scope of supply but shall be temporarily provided
for use by the Contractor during contract execution.

412. The Contractor shall assemble and install all components (including
     all interface connections) on the SCK CEN site.

413. The Contractor and its subcontractors shall apply the local
     regulations applicable on the SCK CEN site, including safety &
     logistic rules and necessary trainings.

414. For all activities on SCK CEN site, the Contractor shall comply
     with the SCK CEN Safety and Health Plan AD2.

415. Utilities (electricity, cooling water, compressed air) except
     fluids (helium and nitrogen) will be supplied free of charge from
     start of installation to end of acceptance tests at the SCK CEN
     site. The Contractor shall provide a list of needed utilities with
     date of availability at the end of the conceptual design and
     updated at the final design

416. The existing cranes in the buildings will be made available for the
     work on site, however, the Contractor shall provide qualified
     operators.

     1.  []{#_Toc200492472 .anchor}Incoming inspection at SCK CEN site

417. Upon arrival on the SCK CEN site at Mol, at least the following
     inspections shall be performed and documented:

-   Inventory control of components.

-   Visual inspections: checking for any damage of the packages,
    examination of the surfaces and welds of the components for cracks.

-   Checking of pressure settings of all volumes after transport by the
    reading of the pressure gauges, and comparison with pressure
    measured before shipment.

-   Checking of all installed shock detectors and accelerometers.

    An incoming inspection report shall be provided by the Contractor
    and approved by SCK CEN (to be included in deliverable DD09 ) before
    starting installation.

    1.  []{#_Toc200492479 .anchor}Test after Mechanical assembly
        completion

418. The Contractor shall perform pneumatic pressure tests on all helium
     service lines to prevent corrosion or degradation of internal
     surfaces. The Contractor shall execute the test methodology in
     accordance with EN 1779, EN 12345, or equivalent industry
     standards, and shall implement safety precautions per ISO 10297

     testing, with particular attention to the interface with the QLM.

420. The Contractor shall perform the following test and verification
     after mechanical assembly completion and document in **DD-5**.

-   Conformance of the assembly with the piping and instrumentation
    diagrams, verification of the labelling.

-   [Inspection of assembly welds shall be performed according the ASME
    standard. Moreover, all cryogenic joint welds shall be 100 %
    X-rayed.]{.mark}

-   Pressure tests of subassemblies with dry nitrogen gas. The
    Contractor shall take in charge all measures concerning safety
    precautions during these pressure tests.

-   Leak tests on subsystems (including warm lines) with recording the
    vacuum level for at least 24 h shall confirm the maximum leak rates
    specified in section

-   All electrical and wiring tests shall be performed on site after
    assembly.

-   Tests of the measuring chains and instrumentation shall be performed
    with the test of the QPLANT:CIS and the inlet/outlet signals.

-   Checking of safety components and particularly the safety valves.

421. An assembly and installation test report shall be provided by the
     Contractor and approved by SCK before starting commissioning.
