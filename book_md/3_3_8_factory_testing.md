         1.  []{#_Toc200492437 .anchor}Welding, pressure, and leak tests

402. As a minimum, the following tests shall be conducted during
     construction of the components.

-   Pressure tests shall be performed in accordance with the design and
    construction code.

-   Leak test shall be performed at ambient temperature after the
    pressure tests.

-   Leak tests of specific cold components (e.g. transfer lines) shall
    be conducted after spraying liquid nitrogen on welds.

    The Contractor, based on his own experience, shall carry out
    additional tests as necessary to ensure specified performance and
    quality.

    1.  []{#_Toc192183302 .anchor}Tests of components

403. All possible functional tests at the manufacturer sites shall be
     performed to detect any faults before delivery and confirm the
     performances indicated in the technical specification. These tests
     shall include at least those mentioned in following requirements.

-   All helium compressors or pumps shall be tested individually at the
    manufacturer's premises. The measured values shall include at least
    flow rate, pressures, temperatures, helium leak, noise level and
    vibrations.

-   Compressor motors shall be tested individually at the manufacturer's
    premises. The measured values shall include at least power
    consumption, temperatures, noise level, vibrations, efficiency, \...

-   Turbines, cold compressors, and cold circulators shall be tested at
    the manufacturer's premise at design rotation speed at ambient
    temperature. Measurements shall include vibrations, rotor stability
    and noise.

-   All cryogenic helium valves shall be delivered with leak test
    certificates of the body and the seat.

-   All safety components shall be delivered with the necessary
    certificates.

    1.  []{#_Toc200492447 .anchor}Electrical, wiring and control system
        tests

404. After mechanical assembly and cabling of any sub-assembly, the
     Contractor shall execute a complete electrical and wiring test. All
     components and cabling shall conform to the international
     electrical standards (IEC). The electrical and wiring tests shall
     include at least:

-   Visual inspection of cabling.

-   Checking of conformity with the electrical wiring diagrams.

-   Checking of correct labelling.

-   Checking of the grounding of all components and measuring of
    insulation resistance for all electrical wiring and electrical
    components.

-   Performing functioning of valves with adjustment of the positioners.

-   Checking of the instrumentation cabling.

-   Checking of the electrical cabinets (instrumentation, power supply
    and control) with injection of inlet signals and detection of outlet
    signals.

405. For the WCS electrical tests, before the connection between the
     motor and the compressor, the Contractor shall:

-   Verify the direction of motor rotation.

-   Check of phase rotation direction on the electrical cubicle busbar
    before switching on 3 phases electrical motors.

406. The QPLANT:CIS operation shall be tested in simulation mode before
     shipment.

     1.  []{#_Toc200492460 .anchor}Transport and Storage

407. The Contractor is responsible for the transport and storage of all
     the QPLANT components from the manufacturing sites to the SCK CEN
     final positioning. It includes the storage, transport, loading,
     unloading and final positioning activities.

408. Prior to transportation, all process circuits of the QPLANT
     components shall be filled with inert gas at a fixed pressure and
     sealed during transport. Necessary caps, blind flanges and hand
     valves shall be considered at that stage. Pressure gauges shall be
     installed and checked at the departure from manufacturer premises
     and at the arrival on SCK CEN site. It is recommended to provide
     transportation boxes with appropriate accelerometers for the
     refrigeration cold box.

409. Appropriate packaging shall protect every item during transport
     from degrading environment, be suitable for the selected transport
     and consider temporary storage in the open air.

410. Each package shall be clearly marked with a label stating the
     Contractor's name, the destination, the name of the component and
     its identification number, the weight, and a link to the
     documentation.

411. Prior to transportation, the package units shall be visually
     inspected at the manufacturer premises and a certificate about
     proper packaging and availability of the necessary documentation
     shall be issued. Representatives of the SCK CEN shall be invited by
     the Contractor to witness the inspection.
