471. The Contractor shall provide the detailed maintenance plan for all
     the QPLANT main components to meet the reliability requirements.

472. The Contractor shall provide the detailed maintenance plan for all
     the QPLANT main components to meet the reliability requirements.

473. The Contractor shall deliver a preventive Functional Test Plan as
     part of the maintenance plan.

474. The Contractor shall provide the detailed maintenance plan for all
     the QPLANT main components to meet the reliability requirements.
     The Contractor shall also deliver a Reliability-Centered
     Maintenance (RCM) Plan, defining failure modes, MTBF,
     inspection/replacement intervals, and spares recommendations for
     each system component. Specific strategies including but not
     limited to:

-   Run to failure

-   Time-based replacement

-   Condition-based maintenance

-   Functional verification (testing)

-   Preventive Functional Test Plan RCM plan

475. The Contractor shall implement a Lifecycle Cost Management (LCM)
     strategy in alignment with a fixed-price contractual framework. The
     LCM shall support informed decision-making across the full system
     lifecycle.

476. The LCM strategy shall integrate the following cost domains as per
     ISO 15288:2023:

-   Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)

-   Operational Expenditure (OPEX)

-   Maintenance forecasting and spares planning

-   Upgrade and obsolescence strategy

-   End-of-life and disposal provisions

477. The Contractor shall ensure compliance with ISO 15686-5 (Lifecycle
     Costing), IEC 60300-3-3 (Reliability-Centred Maintenance), and ISO
     55000 (Asset Management) in the definition of the RCM and LCM
     strategy.

     *In the offer, the Applicant shall i*nclude, as part of their
     Offer, a brief dossier supporting the proposed RCM and LCM
     approach. This dossier shall include:

-   *Summary of the proposed RCM strategy (e.g. run-to-failure,
    time-based, condition-based)*

-   *MTBF values for major QPLANT and QPLANT:CIS components*

-   *Spare part strategy and indicative critical inventory items*

-   *Expected OPEX contributors (e.g. electricity, labour, (liquid
    nitrogen)*

-   *High-level process-flow & safety-integrity summary (PFD/SIL)*

    *If a modelling tool (e.g. process twin or diagnostic simulation) is
    offered, outline the expected benefits, any additional
    hardware/software (BoM) and incremental cost; if no model is
    offered, provide a brief rationale and alternative diagnostic
    approach*

<!-- -->

-   *Planned maintenance & diagnostic activities for a five-year
    horizon*

-   *A clearly labelled item "RCM & LCM implementation" in the
    fixed-price breakdown. If already included in the lump sum, the
    Offer shall state "included in lump sum -- no separate charge."*
