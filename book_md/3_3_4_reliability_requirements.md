<!-- -->

29. The QPLANT shall apply proven processes and be based on industrially
    proven technologies.

30. For failures resulting in an unplanned transition out of the "2K
    operation" scenario, the MTBF shall be higher than 5 years.

31. For failures resulting in an unplanned transition to the "4.5K
    standby" scenario, the MTBF shall be higher than 10 years.

32. For failures resulting in an unplanned warm up of the linac to \>
    4.5K, the MTBF shall be higher than 15 years.

    In the offer, the Applicant shall provide a substantiated
    justification for the MTBF of the QPLANT, including but not limited
    to:

-   Applied redundancy (e.g., N+1, 2oo3)

-   MTBF values for each critical component, with supporting data

-   Summary RAMI considerations and lifecycle-impacting design choice

-   Outline of RCM strategy supporting availability objectives

-   Key failure modes and corresponding mitigation measures (FO, FC, NO,
    NC for critical isolation or segmentation valves shall be provided
    for the LOOP and at least one other scenario (main interfacing
    valves of QRB and WCS)

33. The Contractor shall submit the detailed MTBF calculation
    demonstrating the compliance of the detailed design with the MTBF
    requirements to SCK CEN for review and subsequent approval at the
    latest by the end of the Phase 1. The Contractor shall substantiate
    the MTBF values by manufacturer data (OEM or COTS), field
    performance records, or predictive reliability models. The level of
    detail shall be proportionate to the component's criticality in the
    overall system reliability and availability architecture. The
    Contractor shall also provide a component-level (LRU) replacement
    schedule for the expected lifetime duration of at least 40 years,
    including MTBF data, estimated downtime impact, and cost per
    intervention.
