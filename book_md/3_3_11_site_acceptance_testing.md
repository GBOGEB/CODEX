     1.  []{#_Toc200492507 .anchor}Site Acceptance testing

All tests described in 3.11 shall be conducted under Contractor
responsibility following the local site rules.

The tests on site consist of an incoming inspection after arrival on
site, inspection after positioning of the components, verification after
mechanical assembly completion, a commissioning period for the
Contractor to prepare the QPLANT for acceptance capacity tests. The
acceptance capacity tests aim at verifying the functional operation and
capacity of the WCS alone and then the functional operation and capacity
of the complete QPLANT.[]{#_Toc192762740 .anchor}
