     1.  []{#_Ref190800689 .anchor}Spare Parts

-   In the offer, they need to give us the list of strategic spare parts
    needed for 5/10 years. And a price for the whole package. This is
    the contingent part

-   In the offer, they need to give us a pricelist for all spare parts
    per element. This is not contingent part. This is only to fix the
    price (+price revision formula -\> in the main tender doc? See SSA.)

462. During Contract execution, the Contractor shall expand this list
     into a detailed breakdown, including part references, failure
     assumptions, and cost drivers. A corresponding spares inventory
     shall be defined, including shelf life and storage constraints, in
     alignment with the Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) Plan.

463.  The Contractor shall maintain and provide an up-to-date internal
     inventory of all components, equipment, and services delivered as
     part of the plant. This inventory must include detailed information
     on internal applications, devices, network interfaces, and
     communication protocols used within the plant. The internal
     inventory should be updated and shared with the client whenever any
     changes or updates occur in the plant.

     In their Offer, the Applicant shall provide a detailed list of all
     recommended maintenance and capital spare parts required to support
     the first five (5) years of operation. This list shall include:

-   Identification and description of each spare part.

-   Preventive maintenance and repair recommendations.

-   Unit price.

-   Delivery lead times and any associated storage or handling
    requirements.

-   The Applicant shall pay particular attention to operationally
    critical components---such as turbines, cold compressors, and warm
    compressors---with long procurement lead times. These shall be
    exhaustively identified and justified within the spare parts
    strategy.

    In its Offer, the Applicant shall provide a top-level list of all
    Components that meet either of the following criteria:

-   a mean time between failures (MTBF) of less than ten (10) years, or

-   a projected replacement rate of two (2) or more times within a forty
    (40)-year service life.

-   This list shall focus on cost-relevant or operationally critical
    items and need not include minor components where individual
    replacement costs or impacts are negligible.
