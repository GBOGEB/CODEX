        1.  []{#_Ref190802525 .anchor}Non-Conformity Management

            A Non-Conformity is defined as any non-compliance with, or
            deviation from, any of the requirements and/or conformity
            criteria set forth in the Contract or approved Change
            Requests.

            The Contractor shall have a process in place for managing
            Non-Conformities that arise during the performance of the
            Contract, including receiving and processing notifications
            of Non-Conformities from SCK CEN and/or third parties (such
            as its Contractors or Subcontractors).

            In case of a Non-Conformity, the Contractor may not ship, or
            shall recall at its own risk and expense, the impacted
            supply. Any steps of the Contract execution, which are
            (potentially) affected by the Non‑Conformity, shall be put
            on hold.

            The Contractor shall notify SCK CEN in writing of any such
            Non-Conformities by means of a Non-Conformity Report (NCR).
            An NCR shall be submitted to SCK CEN as soon as reasonably
            possible after a Non-Conformity is identified.

            The NCR shall cover at least the following aspects:

    <!-- -->

    i.  Detailed description of the Non-Conformity.

    <!-- -->

    xi. Identification of all potentially affected deliverables.

    xii. Identified (root) cause(s) including verification thereof.

    xiii. Proposed corrective actions including their anticipated
          effectiveness.

    xiv. Proposed reoccurrence prevention plan (if applicable).

    xv. The Contractor shall include the NCR template in annex to the
        QAP.

    xvi. The NCR shall be submitted to SCK CEN for approval. SCK CEN
         shall be entitled to reject the solution(s) proposed by the
         Contractor in case SCK CEN deems the solution not useable given
         the circumstances.

         The Contractor shall perform the necessary actions to correct
         the Non-Conformity (in accordance with the SCK CEN approved
         NCR) at its own risk and expense. Said necessary actions shall
         not only concern redoing (parts of) the manufacturing and/or
         its related processes (assembly, packaging, delivery, ...) but
         shall also entail redoing all QA/QC activities associated
         therewith. Next to that, if so, requested by SCK CEN, the
         Contractor shall moreover reimburse SCK CEN for the costs
         incurred by SCK CEN to have the FAT/SAT of the impacted items
         redone.

         The Contractor shall keep SCK CEN duly informed about the
         progress of the implementation of the actions identified in the
         NCR and, if applicable, shall provide a revised schedule
         identifying the time impact of the implementation of said
         actions; the Contractor shall minimize the consequences on the
         schedule in any case.

    <!-- -->

    i.  At the specific request of SCK CEN, to avoid repetition of
        possible recurring Non-Conformities during the execution of the
        Contract, or when imposed by the Contractor\'s quality
        management system or the QAP, the Contractor shall carry out a
        root cause analysis of the Non-Conformity. Such an analysis
        shall:

        a.  be documented and submitted for approval to SCK CEN.

        b.  include the identified Non-Conformity cause(s).

        c.  propose an action plan to minimize the probability of a
            recurrence.

    <!-- -->

    ii. For actions taking more than 1 month, the Contractor shall
        provide a regular status report describing the result of
        implementation according to the due dates in the action plan.

    iii. Performing the root cause analysis and implementing any
         preventive/corrective actions arising therefrom, shall not give
         rise to any additional compensation for the Contractor.

         Any Non-Conformities identified and reported by SCK CEN to the
         Contractor, as well as any other complaints received by the
         Contractor from SCK CEN, shall be treated as Non-Conformities
         and duly documented, investigated, and resolved according to
         the stipulations under this clause.

         Neither the implementation of the procedure on Non-Conformity
         management, nor the approval by SCK CEN of a Non-Conformity
         Report, shall waive or reduce the Contractor's responsibility,
         according to the relevant stipulations of the Contract, to
         indemnify and hold SCK CEN harmless against all losses,
         damages, and costs (e.g. due to delay on the schedule) arising
         from such Non-Conformity.[]{#_Toc160432906 .anchor}

         1.  Audits

             SCK CEN shall be entitled to carry out, or to have carried
             out by a third party on its behalf (procured at SCK CEN's
             own cost), an audit of Contractor/its Subcontractor's
             premises, equipment, procedures to assess the ability of
             Contractor/Subcontractor to comply with the requirements of
             this document and the Contract. SCK CEN may request such
             audit when at least one of the following conditions is met:

    <!-- -->

    i.  to qualify a Contractor/Subcontractor which is not ISO 9001
        certified.

    <!-- -->

    ii. to address performance issues.

        SCK CEN shall inform the Contractor in advance of the audit and
        shall take all necessary steps not to unduly interfere with the
        performance of Contractor's business operations. SCK CEN shall
        provide an audit report within two weeks of completing the
        audit. The Contractor shall respond within two weeks with an
        action plan to address the identified Non-Conformities.

        notice by the Contracting Authority to the Contractor on the
        defect and resolving of said defect by the Contractor.

        If the Contractor fails to fulfil its obligations under the
        warranty, so that final acceptance cannot take place at the
        scheduled time, the Warranty Period shall be automatically
        extended, without any right to compensation for the Contractor,
        until final acceptance takes place

        **Warranty Conditions**

        During the warranty period, the Contractor shall at its own risk
        and expense remedy any outstanding issues, as well as any
        shortcomings and defects that were not visible during the
        acceptance tests.

        The Contractor's methods of solving a warranty issue shall
        always need to be approved in advance by SCK CEN. SCK CEN
        reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to not allow for
        repair and to demand replacement of a defective item.

        In case the warranty work needs to be performed at SCK CEN, the
        Contractor shall consider and comply with SCK CEN's instructions
        relating to working hours, access, \..., without being entitled
        to any additional compensation.

        The Contractor's warranty obligation shall not apply:

    <!-- -->

    i.  to normal wear and tear of the QPLANT, as well as any associated
        consumables.

    <!-- -->

    viii. to defects of which the Contractor is notified after the
          Warranty period, unless SCK CEN can demonstrate that such
          defect has arisen before the end of the Warranty period in
          which case such defect shall fall under the warranty
          obligation.

    ix. to failures or defects which the Contractor can substantiate are
        due to alteration, misapplication, inappropriate use in view of
        the conditions of use as outlined by the Contractor (if any are
        provided), and/or maintenance not carried out according to the
        Contractor's nominal conditions as set forth by the Contractor,
        lack of trained maintenance personnel (other than the
        Contractor's personnel), operation above rated capacities either
        intentional or otherwise, or physical damage caused by persons
        other than the Contractor's personnel.

        During the warranty period, the Contractor shall execute repairs
        and/or replacements without undue delay at the Contractor's risk
        and expense. SCK CEN may request warranty service during
        non-normal working hours or for services excluded from the
        warranty coverage as defined herein, provided that SCK CEN shall
        pay the reasonable overtime premium portion of the non-normal
        hours worked or the normal service charge, respectively.

        In-warranty repairs and/or replacement parts shall be warranted
        for at least one year after execution, or for the unexpired
        portion of the original warranty period of the deliverable,
        whichever is longest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
        warranty period is suspended for the duration between formal
        notice by SCK CEN to the Contractor on the defect and resolving
        of said defect by the Contractor.

        If the Contractor fails to fulfil its obligations under the
        warranty, so that final acceptance cannot take place at the
        scheduled time, the warranty period shall be automatically
        extended, without any right to compensation and/or remuneration
        for the Contractor, until final acceptance takes place.

        The Contractor shall keep a register of all interventions that
        the Contractor performs during the warranty period which can be
        always consulted by SCK CEN. If SCK CEN can demonstrate a trend
        of failure occurring during the warranty period, which is not
        attributable to any inappropriate use of the equipment, this
        will be considered as a deficiency, and the Contractor shall be
        liable to replace at his own risk and expense the affected item

        In addition to the above rights, SCK CEN shall be entitled to
        full compensation for all damages incurred in view of these
        outstanding issues, shortcomings, and/or defects during the
        warranty period for which the Contractor is responsible.

        The warranty as described in this section shall in no way
        constitute a restriction on the applicable Belgian statutory
        regulations on hidden defects.

    3.  []{#_Toc202536294 .anchor}Final acceptance

        Initial acceptance occurs after the successful completion of the
        Warranty Period, at the written request of the Contractor, on
        the condition that all defects, attributable to the Contractor,
        regardless of whether they have been identified in the
        Provisional Acceptance Certificate or during the Warranty
        Period, have been duly resolved by the Contractor. If the
        conditions are met, a Final Acceptance Certificate will be
        issued by SCK CEN within 10 Business Days after receipt of the
        Contractor's written request in this respect.
